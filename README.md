# Frontend Mentor - Results summary component solution

This is my solution to the Results summary component challenge on Frontend Mentor. I built it using semantic HTML and pure CSS, following a mobile-first and responsive design approach. This challenge helped me strengthen my layout, styling, and problem-solving skills.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on the screen size (responsive design)
- See hover and focus states on interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM methodology
- Media Queries for responsiveness


### What I learned

In this challenge I learned a lot about:

- Using flexbox to center and align elements across various screen sizes.
- How to structure HTML semantically, using tags like `main`, `section`, `article`, and `footer`.
- The importance of BEM (Block Element Modifier) for keeping CSS structured and scalable.
- How to fix overflow and broken layouts when testing on small screens.
- Writing media queries to make a layout adapt well to both large and small devices.

I also understood the importance of writing reusable, scalable code that behaves well on different devices, and how to apply visual hierarchy using CSS.

```css
.container {
  max-width: 400px;
  margin: auto;
  padding: 2rem;
  border-radius: 1rem;
}
```


## Continued development

Moving forward, I want to:

- Improve my understanding of Flexbox and Grid combinations for better control of complex layouts.
- Practice more on media queries to ensure perfect responsive behavior.
- Study and use CSS `clamp()`, `min()`, `max()` for fluid sizing.
- Learn more about accessibility and ARIA roles.
- Later, apply JavaScript and APIs to dynamically populate components like this one.

## Acknowledgments

Big thanks to ChatGPT for helping me understand complex CSS behavior, suggesting better structuring methods, and giving me useful hints without solving everything for me.  
Although I asked for occasional help to solve some problems, the entire structure and final code are mine.
